Usage example employing Lasagne for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
This example is deliberately structured as a long flat file, focusing on how
to use Lasagne, instead of focusing on writing maximally modular and reusable
code. It is used as the foundation for the introductory Lasagne tutorial:

# ##################### Build the neural network model #######################

# function that takes a Theano variable representing the input and returns
# the output layer of a neural network model built in Lasagne.

def build_mlp(input_var=None):
    # This creates an MLP of two hidden layers of 800 units each, followed by
    # a softmax output layer of 10 units. It applies 20% dropout to the input
    # data and 50% dropout to the hidden layers.

    # Input layer, specifying the expected input shape of the network
    # (unspecified batchsize, 1 channel, 28 rows and 28 columns) and
    # linking it to the given Theano variable `input_var`, if any:
